Tutorlyte is a high-quality, paid tutoring program focused on helping students with difficult competition and school curriculum. We provide handouts for every session along with problem sets to reinforce the concepts learned during the hour long classes. An example of a handout is provided. More information regarding the specific courses and payment can be found here.

# Instructors
Classes are currently taught by Dylan Yu and Rushil Shah. We are two prospective MIT '27 students who aim to help others with their academic endeavors. Having participated in competitions and taken advanced classes at school, we understand the importance and difficulty of these topics. So, using the experience that we have gained, we wish to provide high-quality education for competitions and school curriculum to those eager to pursue their academic goals.
